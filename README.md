# House-Rent-Analysis
This repository contains a complete end-to-end data science project using Python, focused on predicting house rent prices based on features such as size, number of rooms, location, and more.
The project was developed to practice and deepen knowledge from Chapter 9 onward of the Data Science Academy course, covering:

- Data manipulation and analysis with NumPy and Pandas
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Linear Regression (Simple and Multiple) modeling using statsmodels and scikit-learn
- Optional integration with SQLite databases
- Model evaluation with metrics such as R², MAE, and RMSE

📁 Dataset
This project uses the House Rent Prediction dataset from Kaggle.

🎯 Objective
Explore the relationship between housing features and rental prices, and build a predictive model capable of estimating monthly rent based on the available variables.

🧠 Techniques To Be Applied
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory statistical analysis
- Visualization of patterns and outliers
- Explanatory and predictive linear regression
- Model performance evaluation with relevant metrics
- Feature engineering and model refinement

📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Coefficient of Determination (R²)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
